        <div class="section-qualifications-block">
        Nothing here to see.... <br>Not that I don't have any qualification, just too lazy add them right now in a clean way! ðŸ‘¾.

        Well basically my two most important achievements are:
        <ul>
        <li>Google Associate Cloud Engineer</li>
        <li>IBM Advanced Certification in Datascience</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
